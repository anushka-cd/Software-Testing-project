# Test-Scenario-Generator

The Automatic Test Case Scenario Generation tool is developed to automatically generate test cases for behavioral UML state diagrams, based on the tree structure and the concept of Genetic
Algorithm.
The tool and its requirements are only pertaining to the functionality needed to implement the test case generation tool.
The main purpose is to specify a set of usage scenarios that will cover all activity diagram
transitions with the minimum amount of work.
The test case content will be based on the diagram nodes name, documentation and other metadata. It is concluded that the better the activity diagram is documented the more detailed the resulting test cases will be. Additional text is added to remember the tester to verify situations like decisions, fork/joins, etc.
